      <h2>What are Hacker Hours?</h2>
      <p>Hacker Hours is a completely open space for people to receive programming help, work on homework or projects, or to just hang out and talk with other like-minded people. We're a community of programmers, developers, and designers, focused on helping you learn to code and get better and what you do.</p>
